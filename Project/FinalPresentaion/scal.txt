Code instrumentation was particulartly interesting for us when trying to gauge the performance of parallelized code using MPI. In this case we used manual instrumentation directly in the main function and analyzed the performance over all iterations. This lead us to the understanding that even when overlapping communication and computations the performance does not increase significantly as computations take more time than that needed for communication, for adequate problem size. 
We also used instrumentation to better understand the performance of OpenMP and vectorized code. In our performance tests we tried to keep in mind that scalasca introduces some additional overhead.
